        <p>"Reacting in anger or annoyance will not advance one’s ability to persuade." Great quote, often spoken by my wife in her workplace in a slightly different way - "Anger or annoyance at every little (or big) thing takes so much more energy than trying to stay positive." Definitely does not advance the ability to persuade. Way to go RBG!!</p>
